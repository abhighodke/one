    aboutMeDetailed: `Tania Michaels embarked on her real estate journey in 1993, initially in the mortgage industry. In 2003, she caught the attention of a major land developer, who recruited her for land acquisitions. During her tenure at Focus Commercial Group, Tania brokered over 2,000 acres of land, totaling $215 million.

Her role at Focus Commercial Group involved collaboration with a team of in-house planners, zoning attorneys, and engineers. When the Great Recession hit, Tania shifted her focus to negotiating short sales on commercial properties in default, a transition that later extended to residential properties. Having started her real estate career in the mortgage industry, Tania, a nationally recognized mortgage broker, brought a wealth of knowledge about the banking maze and nearly two decades of real estate negotiation experience to the short sale market.

Tania quickly emerged as a prominent figure in the residential real estate market, excelling as a top-producing agent for both traditional and default property sales. Recognitions followed, including being named:
